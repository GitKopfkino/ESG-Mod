  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip5Title">Blockading a Star System will prevent most factions from being able to colonize it</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip33Title">Make sure you use your influence! Laws are very powerful tools you don’t want to be missing out on.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip34Title">Sophons have excellent ships, with each ship having an extra slot with no limitations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip35Title">Quality over quantity! Horatio’s ships have one less module slot then other faction’s ships, but have bonus health and shields equal to a portion of the industry cost used to produce them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip36Title">Be careful around the Lumeris! They colonize quickly and ignore blockades.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip37Title">Every faction has a unique behemoth module available to them on the Juggernaut Blueprints technology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip38Title">Bombers are powerful weapons for taking out larger ships quickly; make sure you don’t neglect them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip39Title">Trade Companies are an incredibly effective way to increase your luxury resource production, though they will take time to develop.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip40Title">Food is important not just for growing new populations, but also for growing your manpower.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip41Title">Explorers can turn invisible once you research Vacuum Protection, allowing them to effectively scout enemy territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip42Title">Modules with effects highlighted in #C48594#Red#REVERT# scale depending on the size of the ship. Modules with effects highlighted in #6999D5#Blue#REVERT# scale with the size and level of the ship equipping them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip43Title">Modules that require strategic resources to use often have unusual effects that could turn the tide of a battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip44Title">Are an enemy’s defenses too potent? Try softening up their system with a few planet crackers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip45Title">A Faction Pact benefits both empires involved, with the bonus given to you being determined by the faction you are signing a pact with.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip46Title">Be careful not to let your diplomatic pressure get too high, if it reaches the minimum then the other faction can make a devastating demand. Declaring war will prevent/negate this effect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip47Title">Influence is used for diplomacy, laws, and powerful repeatable system improvements. Make sure not to use it all in one place.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip48Title">Controlling a majority of the systems in a constellation will provide a powerful bonus.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip49Title">Once the Unfallen have vined a planet it is hard to get rid of them!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip50Title">The United Empire has the ability to spend influence to instantly complete or purchase technologies, buildings, ships and resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip51Title">The Nakalim can build a Temple on a planet, allowing them to convert nearby systems very quickly. However, this comes at the cost of reducing the natural output of that planet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip52Title">The Hissho aren’t great at controlling many systems, and compensate by mining planets with Behemoths. The economic gains from their unique mining abilities generally exceed those from colonization!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip53Title">Minor populations will provide a special empire-wide bonus when there are 20 of them within your empire. Major populations will provide a powerful empire-wide bonus when there are 50 of them within your empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip54Title">Boosting a population in the Population Overview screen will double the rate at which that population type grows, while also doubling its innate bonuses. Each population type has its own preferred resource you need to boost it with.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip55Title">Every action you take will affect the political opinion of your citizens, take your actions carefully!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip56Title">You do know best! Dictatorships choose which party gets to be in power twice as often, switch to whatever party suits your empire's needs. In addition to these, they get a reliable set of always available independent laws!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip57Title">Republic is a great government for empires with a lot of influence to spend, their laws are much more effective than anyone else's.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip58Title">If you want to pass more laws at once (at reduced cost!), Democracy is an amazing government type.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip59Title">If your empire is having trouble expanding, the Federation government type would be perfect for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip60Title">Kinetic weapons will be mostly absorbed against well-armored ships, maybe try using some energy weapons instead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip61Title">Shields are fantastic for absorbing energy weapons, but don’t underestimate their value against kinetic weapons as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip62Title">Beams are well rounded weapons good for almost every situation, but don’t have any notable strengths.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip63Title">Missiles may provide a lot of damage, but they can be shot down by enemy flak. Maybe try mixing in some Swarm Missiles with your Missiles to confuse enemy flak.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip64Title">Know your opponent hasn’t been manning their ships properly? Attacking ships with boarding pods kills the crew, and once all the crew is dead you will take the ship for yourself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip65Title">Ships get a bigger damage bonus the closer they are to being completely manned.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip66Title">Critical hits will ignore enemy shields and armor, allowing you to quickly shred well-defended ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip67Title">The Blast Effect Battery can be used to utterly decimate fleets with many small ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip68Title">Make sure you manage Approval properly! Letting your citizens get unhappy could lead to revolt. Content citizens produce more food and influence, with angry citizens producing less food and influence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip69Title">Curiosities aren’t just there to show you where resource deposits are, sometimes they have powerful weapons and buildings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip70Title">EMPs can be used to disable either an enemy’s weapons or shields. This can be a very powerful tool if you use it properly!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip71Title">Invading systems will require a lot of time and effort, softening it up by sieging it for a few turns can make the battle go much more in your favor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip72Title">Minor factions are nothing to scoff at, some have powerful faction traits, others have powerful population. Acquiring them is always a boon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip73Title">Coordinators are great for absorbing powerful hits, and can be fitted with powerful modules that provide flotilla-wide buffs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip74Title">Pick your tactics cards carefully! Many have negative effects that could not only cripple your enemy, but also YOU if you use them incorrectly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip75Title">Don’t ignore your faction quest, it can provide you with powerful bonuses and abilities that will be useful to you the whole game.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip76Title">You can manage your entire empire from the Empire Summary screen, without even having to look at the galaxy map.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip77Title">Be careful when entering an Unfallen’s territory, the vines slow down your ships if you aren’t friendly with them, while speeding up theirs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip78Title">Need to boost sheer production of ships and buildings quickly? The Industrialist Party has the laws you need.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip79Title">If you have a variety of strong population types or anomalies and want to make use of them, Ecologist Party laws are ideal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip80Title">To dominate the enemy in battle and save on the costs of your navy, use the laws of the Militarist Party.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip81Title">The Pacifist Party laws are excellent for making new friends and turning a profit from galactic business like Luxuries and Trade Routes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip82Title">If you need to know your enemy and bypass their defenses, the Scientist Party can help you gain the advantage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip83Title">The Religious Party can help you build a strong economy despite a lack of territory or resources by harnessing Heroes, special nodes, and the spoils of your enemies worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip84Title">Plan on killing a lot of ships in the near future? Modules and hero skills that provide a resource per Command Points destroyed could give you a powerful surplus of said resource.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip85Title">Don’t have any planets left to colonize? Your colonization ships could be converted into siege or invasion ships that batter an enemy’s defenses!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip86Title">Trade agreements give you access to luxuries produced by other empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip87Title">Pay attention to the innate bonuses of your populations, it could be worthwhile to send them to a more effective system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip88Title">Mercenary Ships have an improved privateering, though at an increased cost. It may be a good idea to... keep your Ally in check next time they act up.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip89Title">Hot planets are great for producing industry, but tend to have terrible science. Next time you’re looking for additional industry, it may be a good idea to colonize a system with multiple hot planets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip90Title">Fertile planets are the perfect climate for growing food and holding population. If you’re wanting to grow a lot of population and quickly, a Fertile planet is your best bet. Fertile planets tend to not produce as much industry or science per population though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip91Title">Cold planets are the ideal planet type to set up some laboratories to produce research. If you’re ever feeling behind in the tech tree, a Cold planet might be the thing you need to catch up, though be wary that it will be hard to build infrastructure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip92Title">Sterile planets are good for specializing into a specific resource determined by planet temperature, and innately produce more dust than fertile planets. Though they tend to not have as many population slots as Fertile planets, they have more than a gas planet will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip93Title">Nakalim players can’t produce science from planets, meaning cold planets are entirely useless to them. This is also the ideal place to build temples, since the malus doesn’t affect you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip94Title">If you’re willing to wait, send a Warning and a Prepare for War declaration, and after the warning expires you will be able to declare war for very cheap. The best part is, if you decide it’s not worth waiting you can still declare a surprise war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip95Title">Finding diplomacy too expensive? Send a praise to another faction, it drastically lowers the cost of positive diplomacy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip96Title">All Trading Company headquarters will trade with every trading subsidiary, and vice versa. However, headquarters will not trade with each other, and similarly subsidiaries will only trade with headquarters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip97Title">Bombers do not take accuracy penalties and ignore enemy evasion, great for dealing with pesky Umbral Choir fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip98Title">Trade routes produce dust and luxuries primarily based on the level of development of the systems containing the headquarters and subsidiary. This enables them to scale as your overall empire develops!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip99Title">Trade routes will generate luxury resources not only from the systems containing the headquarters and subsidiary, but also from the directly surrounding colonized systems. However, other systems along the trade route will NOT contribute luxuries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip100Title">The more industry something costs to build, the greater the dust cost to buyout, so buyouts can get very expensive very quickly. It’s more effective to buy out cheaper buildings than expensive ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip101Title">The Umbral Choir is not affected by the negative effects of special nodes! Be wary of being lured into a trap.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip102Title">The Umbral Choir’s beacons provide special empire-wide bonuses depending on which special node they are placed on! More beacons means more bonuses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip103Title">Economic Behemoths are powerful tools--just be sure to continue moving them to new systems so that they can help build up infrastructure in new locations!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip104Title">Riftborn ships may be fragile, but they make up for it in firepower. Riftborn ships have, on average, more weapons than any other faction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip105Title">Craver ships have 10% less hp then other factions, to compensate for this that can command larger fleets, an effective strategy for dealing with these swarms is to use AOE battle effects such as the blast effect battery heavy weapon and the collateral damage battle card, both found in the military tree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip106Title">Assigning a hero to a system can be the difference between mediocrity and greatness, make sure to utilize them wisely. Similarly, assigning a hero to a fleet can be the difference between decisive victory and embarrassing defeat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip107Title">Finding the colors available to each faction to be too similar? Switch to the Saturated color palette in the settings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip108Title">All defensive hacking programs provide protection against one specific capital hack--be sure to choose wisely which outcomes are important to protect against!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip109Title">Want to move populations between systems? System Modernization provides access to the spaceport, which allows you to ship populations to greener pastures.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip110Title">Be careful! Pirates spawn in waves and can cripple an unprepared empire. However, if you are ready for their arrival, destroyed pirate ships are an excellent source of resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip111Title">The circles underneath a system’s name represent planets! Unfilled circles mean that you can’t currently colonize that planet, filled means that you can colonize it. If it has a ring, then it’s a unique planet with a resource bonus. If it’s colored, another empire has an outpost or colony on it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip112Title">The circles underneath a system’s name represent planets! If they pulsate every few seconds, then they have a curiosity for you to search. If it has a rotating line around it, a faction is currently mining it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip113Title">When looking in the galaxy view, the box behind a system’s name represents its system level. If it has no border, it is level 1. If it has a bright border on the top and bottom, it is level 2. If it has a bright border on all edges, it is level 3. If it is completely filled in with a bright color, it is level 4.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip114Title">The more population you have, the higher the requirement to grow the next one, and the more food your system consumes. Make sure you invest in food or your empire will stagnate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip115Title">Ships kept in a system’s hangar will have less upkeep and heal faster, but can’t participate in any military operations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip116Title">It may be worthwhile to orbit an unused fleet around a special node. Some of them increase your vision range, give beneficial combat bonuses, or provide experience gain per turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip117Title">Be careful when passing through a Vaulter system, they can teleport any ship to any of their systems within a blink of an eye!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip118Title">The Unfallen have one crippling weakness, if you take an Unfallen system, then all vined systems connected to it will be detached from the vine network and die! Taking the Unfallen’s home system means a guaranteed death for the Unfallen player.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip119Title">If another faction has a system with an influence radius that covers your system, a great way to prevent them from converting it is by declaring war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip120Title">Remember, the Riftborn can’t use food when creating outposts, instead, they value high industry-producing planets like Ash, Lava, or Burning Gas.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip121Title">New populations are grown once you have an accumulated stock of 300 food (scaling with game speed). Any food over this number is counted towards growing the next population, but you can only grow one population per turn. If you have too much food, there are technologies that will convert excess food stock into other resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip122Title">Mining Behemoths are great for gathering luxury and strategic resources that would otherwise be unavailable to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip123Title">The Hissho have the ability to add a portion of the [fidsi] on each planet they mine to every planet on their home system, allowing their single system to experience the growth of an entire empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip124Title">Science Behemoths are great for achieving a Science Victory, and can be used to lower the science costs of technologies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip125Title">The Academy will grant its benefactors roles with powerful bonuses... to those who can win his auction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip126Title">The cost of technologies will slowly increase as you research more! Make sure you pick what you research first wisely!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip127Title">Systems can store up to one turn of Industry! If you forget to queue up something to build, or you start on something that doesn't take industry to build, you'll be able to use it next turn!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip128Title">You can store up to one turn of Science! This means that if you forget to queue a technology for a turn, you won't take any penalties! This also means that any Science earned through destroying ships is lost if you earn more than you naturally produce per turn!</LocalizationPair>
 
  <!-- ESG new-->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip129Title">Don't Forget to boost your pop!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip130Title">Independent [Politics] laws need to be unlocked by doing elections like any other party, the election result doesn't matter to them though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip131Title">Gas giants [Telluric] give the most Fidsi [fidsi] per pop, but suffer from a lack of pop slots and approval penalties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip132Title">The United Empire starts out industrialist [industrialist] but can pivot mid match to a Scientist [Scientist] or Militarist [Militarist] empire by completing their quest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip133Title">Hero [Hero] Skills come in four types, Labour [MasteryLabour] which increases system yields on the system they're assigned on, Wit [MasteryWit] increases Empire yields on the system they're assigned on, Curiosity [MasteryCuriosity] increases a fleet's overal exploration power and Command [MasteryCommand] increases your fleets combat power.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip134Title">Horatio's splice cost will never exceed 10 population.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip135Title">Don't Forget to upgrade your system development!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip136Title">Don't Forget to set up trade infrastructure! (if you have the technology)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip137Title">Don't Forget to upgrade your troops!</LocalizationPair>
